11. **S19**: Text Overlays (builds on S12; adds title/caption capability)

### Phase 7 Build Order (STRETCH - QoL Features)
12. **S20**: Keyboard Shortcuts (pure QoL; can be done anytime)
13. **S21**: Undo/Redo (builds on MVP; enhances user confidence)
14. **S22**: Enhanced Auto-Save (builds on MVP S8; improves reliability)

## Phasing Summary

### Phase 5: Recording & Advanced Editing (REQUIRED)
- 5 Features (S9-S13 core + S15 audio)
- Delivery: Full recording and advanced timeline capability
- Target: Features that unlock new user workflows (screen recording, PiP, multi-track)

### Phase 6: Effects & Advanced Export (MIXED)
- 2 REQUIRED (S14, S15), 4 STRETCH (S16-S19)
- REQUIRED: Advanced export and audio controls (complete MVP → Full submission)
- STRETCH: Effects and transitions (polish)

### Phase 7: Polish & Reliability (STRETCH)
- 3 STRETCH (S20-S22)
- QoL: Keyboard shortcuts, undo/redo, crash recovery

## Notes for Implementation Team

1. **Prioritize REQUIRED Features First**: S9-S15 block final submission. Get these done before stretching.

2. **Dependency Respect**: Don't start S11 until S9+S10 done. Don't start S18 until S17 done, etc.

3. **Testing Gates**: Each story includes specific testing criteria. Verify happy path, edge cases, and error handling before marking "done."

4. **Audio is Critical**: S15 (Audio Capture & Controls) is REQUIRED and needed by recording features. Prioritize audio handling and sync.

5. **Cross-Platform**: All features tested on macOS (primary) + Windows (best-effort).

6. **Performance Benchmarks**: Timeline stays responsive with 10+ clips. Playback ≥30fps. Export completes without crashes.

7. **Definition of Done**: Each story has specific criteria. Don't merge PR until all acceptance tests pass.

8. **Tech Stack**: Electron + Vite + React + TypeScript + FFmpeg (as established in MVP)

**Document Status**: Ready for Development
**Next Step**: Create detailed PRDs for each story (in dependency order)
